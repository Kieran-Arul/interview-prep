## Project Overview

- The purpose of this repo is to prepare for interviews in an organised way
- We will commit a solution and explanation to every problem we solve and comfortably understand
- We aim to solve about 1-2 questions a day
- Solutions will be stored by pattern and difficulty
- Problems will mostly be from LeetCode, Grokking the Coding Interview and HackerRank
- If you notice any errors in our code, or perhaps optimisations we could make, please let us know

## For Contributors

1\. Clone the repository (if you are a new contributor)

    git clone https://github.com/Kieran-Arul/interview-prep

2\. If you are adding a new question pattern, do so in the 'patterns' directory at /src/com/patterns. Then update the README appropriately.

3\. If you are adding a new difficulty to one of the patterns, remember to update the README appropriately.

4\. If you are adding a new question, ensure it is added to the correct pattern, difficulty and language directory.

5\. When adding a new question, ensure the filename is the name of the question

6\. At the top of each question file, include:

  - A brief of what the question/problem is
  - Where this question came from (e.g. LeetCode question number)
  - Example input, expected output of the example input (similar to how LeetCode does it)
  - Short explanation why that is the output (if it is not obvious)

7\. If you add a new question file, add some comments explaining the logic of your solution. This should be done in either a single block or within the code depending on what is more appropriate.
