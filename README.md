## Project Overview

- The purpose of this repo is primarily to help others also approach the interview preparation process in a more organised way
- I will commit a solution and explanation to every problem I solve and comfortably understand
- I aim to solve about 1-2 questions a day
- Solutions will be stored by pattern and difficulty
- Problems will mostly be from LeetCode, Grokking the Coding Interview and HackerRank
